            This data analysis project delves into the intricate relationship
            between historical daily weather data for France and its correlation
            with electricity consumption. Navigating through ten detailed steps,
            the analysis includes data retrieval, correlation matrix
            calculations, synchronization of time series, and the application of
            multivariate regression models. From fitting quadratic models to
            exploring the impact of day-of-the-week effects, each step
            contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics at
            play.

          <p className="bio" style={{ color: "grey" }}>
            In this report, I present a comprehensive analysis of a Credit Card
            Segmentation and Prediction project. The context involves utilizing
            machine learning techniques to classify credit card users into
            distinct segments. The problem stems from the need to understand
            user behavior and tailor financial services accordingly. My main
            purpose is to develop a predictive model for segmenting credit card
            users based on their transactional patterns. The approach includes a
            detailed process overview, data preparation, exploratory data
            analysis, performance metric selection, unsupervised and supervised
            model building, learning curve-based model debugging, and model
            deployment.
